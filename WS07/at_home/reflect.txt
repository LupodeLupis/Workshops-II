1.	Does the Hero class need to know about the existence of the SuperHero class? (Hint: do a search in Hero.cpp, does the word “SuperHero” appear anywhere?) 
	Because the SuperHero class is a child or Derived class and it is built on the basis of Hero, the Base class does not need to know the existence about the Superhero.

2.	Does the SuperHero class need to know about the existence of the Hero class? (Hint: do a search in SuperHero.cpp, does the word “Hero” appear anywhere?)
	Yes, It does. In order to have inheritance between classes the derived class has to deal with the base class. The Derived Class might hinerit the base class member function or add new data member
	in order to satisfy the requirements by which the classes are designed. 
	On the other hand, a derived class cannot inerith special function (Constructor/Copy Assignment Operator/Destructor).

3.	The program prints out “Ancient Battle!” when 2 Heroes fight. It prints out “Super Fight!” when 2 SuperHeroes fight. 
	When you tried to make a Hero fight a SuperHero, what did it print out?
	Ancient Battle! 
	
4.	True or False: are the following a valid program definition for main? 


int main()
{
  Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5);
}

 ---answer -  Yes



how about this?


int main()
{
 (Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5)) 
                          *
 (Hero("Atalanta", 10, 3) * Hero("Hippolyta", 10, 2));

 ---answer -  Yes




( **The last Quiz reflection on LAB 6 was related to quiz n°6 )

Quiz 7 Reflection. 

Total score 10/10.


Quiz 8 Reflection (Inerithence and Class Hierarchy Example)

An example of class hierarchy can be described by the BASE Class named Car and a DERIVED Class name Model where the data member of the Base can be declared as:

- char name,
- int year;

the data member of the Derived class can be:

- char type ( sport or berlin).
- int engine (hp)
- char color


** I will write the next two quizzes reflections (9 and 10) in the last Workshop (Template).
