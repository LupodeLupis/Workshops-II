1)	Explain why the copy assignment operator checks for self-assignment before doing anything else.	
	The copy assignment check if any previous object of the same type exists in the program. This prevent to copy resources in an object that might cointain
	data and has memory allocated.	

2)	How did you avoid duplication of code?
	I introduced a member function as private in order to validate the phone number and call the function when it was necessary without interfere with the main.cpp file.

3)	List what you have learned in completing this workshop
	- Definition and syntax of copy costruct and assignment oerator
	- Direct call method  for copy construct and assigment opearator
	- Review  of utilization fuction as private member in order to avoid duplication of code and without interfere with the source code
	- Review modulus

Quiz 6 Reflection. 

Error: the member function were incoherent with the class name.
