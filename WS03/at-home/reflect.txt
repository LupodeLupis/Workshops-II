1)	What is the size of each C-style character string that stores a family or given name for the account? Why?

	The size of the of the C-style character is the length of the string given +1 which  refers to the Null terminator.
	When we allocate memory for a char pointer, the size of the array can be found trough the "strlen" function which allow to know the
	memory  needed at the run time. 
	Defining the Family name and Given name as pointer as implicit member we don't know exactley the memory that will occur to store data at the begin
	of the program.

2)	Your class declares two member functions named set(...).  In C, this would generate an error.  Explain why C++ allows this.

	The C++ language recognize the member function through its signature which define if a function is overloaded or not
	Even though the name of two functios can be the same the important is to definie different parameters


3)	What have you learned during this workshop?
	During this workshop I dealt again with  the dynamic memory and how to declare the construct and deconstruct
	Also, I did a great review of the modulus operator.
