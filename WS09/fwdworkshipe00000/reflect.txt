1. It gives  "unresolved external symbol" error and fails to compile.
   It compiles well in header.

2. The template should place before main() function to perform properly.

3. If I did not use template, I need to define same logic for all different type.
   Template reduces duplication of same logic by replace type of function.

4. In this workshop, it does not show any differences either i use <class t> or <typename t>
   I cannot assure they are equivlent.
